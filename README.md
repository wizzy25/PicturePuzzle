# PicturePuzzle
My very first JS project, cloned from my gitlab account :)

A puzzle that randomizes numbers that should be arranged in correct order... Just for fun... Front-end stuff ;)

There is no back-end to this project as it was thought-up to be completely front-end based (would probably come up with something later ;))
